# MPR News v2

## How it was made

This is the first of our apps built with Next.js to help with Server-Side Rendering and Hot Module Reloading, among other things. I started with the `with-apollo` template for `create-next-app`, using the command `create-next-app --example with-apollo mpr-news-next`. The other capabilities we need will be set up by me.

## Google Analytics Set-Up
Login in to LastPass and navigate to Shared-SWAG\Google and locate Google Analytics API - MPR NEWS. In the notes, copy the json. Then create a new file, called google-api-keyfile.json in /config and paste the json from LastPass.
